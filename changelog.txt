Changes since 13.10.20:
 - New Features:
    -- Messages - Messages show in Administration Panel to manage site-messages 
       easily. Supports viewing messages from all stores in multi-store setups
       for quicker access. Messages can also be deleted from Admin Panel and
       pass through PHP's sanitize filters for safety. The Contact Form also
       deploys hidden fields that if populated will prevent messages from spam 
       bots from being sent. This is in addition to the optional reCaptcha which
       is highly recommended unless you have plans to install something else.
       Also added a check-box so visitors must confirm they agree to your Terms 
       and Privacy Policy before contacting you. Duplicate messages that are 
       submitted with the same name + e-mail + comments will overwrite 
       themselves reducing the possibility of duplicate messages.
    -- Seamless Scrolling - This requested feature is made possible by jScroll. 
       n3u Niche Store fully integrated jScroll with its existing Pagination
       structure. Should a visitor view your site and have java-script disabled, 
       n3u Niche Store will safely display the traditional Pagination instead. 
       Pagination is removed with seamless scrolling to prevent Pagination 
       clutter which helps to create a seamless and modern browsing experience.
       Seamless Scrolling is featured in all templates except for lite. Should
       you prefer to disable this, you will need to open the templates main js
       file and remove the line that mentions jScroll and delete from the 
       templates folder the file named jquery.jscroll.min.js
    -- Index Page is now smarter and will better detect blank images and show a 
       "No Image" png in place of the blank image when Caching is enabled.
    -- SEO Improvement - Added Schema.org Markup to Search and Item Pages.
       See http://www.schema.org/Product
    -- Block system has been rewritten. Blocks no longer determine position or 
       order via filenames or paths. Instead, These values are now read/written 
       from/to a single hostname_block_config.php file that contains values for 
       all blocks. Block positions and sorting orders may still be fully 
       configured through the Admin Panel. Blocks are automatically deleted and 
       added to the block_config if removed or added to the Blocks directory.
       Going forward, Blocks will no longer risk being duplicate and thus Blocks
       will again be packaged in each release as opposed to downloading them
       separately. By default blocks will be disabled and need to be enabled in
       the Admin Panel.
 - Changes:
    -- Updated jQuery to version 2.1.0
    -- Dir_Sizes are now cached if caching is enabled. This will greatly speedup
       the admin dashboard loading times. To keep results of caching sizes more 
       current, this cache expires/renews on 1/4th of the cache lifetime.
       Thus if the lifetime is 24 hours, this will cache for 6 hours.
    -- Separated Admin Style for easier management.
    -- Cleaned up the display of Debugging Info.
    -- Improved detection of blank images, These should no longer be cached.
    -- With the introduction of the new Message feature, server reliance on the 
       mail() protocol has been phased out. Should you need to reply to a
       message, You may click the senders email address and your operating 
       systems default email client or web browser will auto-fill with the data.
    -- Cleaned up Admin Panel and removed many of the auto-collapse legends. 
       Also styled a few things to create a more consistent browsing experience.
    -- Updated some language settings
    -- Updated copyrights to reflect 2014.
    -- Increase checking of Image Cache Expiration from 45 days to 60 days old.
    -- Many adjustments, cleanup and optimizations to existing code.
    -- The include_dir is now automatically created if one don't exist.
    -- Added the msg_dir configVar (automatically created if one don't exist)
    -- Fixed img_dir not remembering path settings when updated from default.
 - Block Specific:
    -- Updated Banner Rotator block to include block position styling.
    -- Updated Categories Block with new Admin links.
    -- Updated Back To Top styling.
 - Template Specific:
    -- On n3u template, The Top Menu is now fully centered. Also added little 
       drop down tri-angle.
    -- Deleted admin.php and TemplateName_admin.css files from all templates 
       since the Admin Panel is now considered a separate single template.
    -- Added new template, BlueJay (available on the web-site).
    -- Fix bug where the Auto-linking of search terms/merchants and brands were
       injecting links into the meta description on all templates.
    -- SEO Improvement: Meta Descriptions are now limited to 160 characters max
       for item pages since other pages use shorter descriptions currently.
    -- SEO Improvement: W3C recommends titles are no longer than 64 characters.
       This is done by limiting the title to 55 Characters + SiteName to allow 
       for a 9 character buffer to be reserved for the sites title.
    -- Fixed Merchant and Brand links for search result pages on all templates. 
       Brands/Merchants now link to specific searches instead as first intended.
    -- Numerous style changes/fixes to each template.


Changes since 13.09.07:
 - New Features:
    -- n3u Niche Store now supports multiple domains/installations and unique 
       settings for each. Simply point your domains/subdomains to the same
       n3u Niche Store installation and setup each from it's own admin panel.
       Note that each domain does not see each other but will share core files
       assuming you leave the paths alone or configure all to match.
 - Changes:
    -- Seperated administration css into it's own file within template folder.
       This reduces page request size and speeds up page load time by not 
       needing to process unused CSS for non-admin visitors.
    -- Error reporting now displays errors if debug mode is enabled but hides 
       them if debug mode is disabled.
    -- CSS, JS & Search Result cache files now moved to cache/hostname. This is 
       to distinguish between various templates when used with multiple domains.
    -- Moved custom pages from templates/template_name/custom/ to inc/custom/
       This change will make custom pages show up between all templates. If 
       you've setup custom pages previously, you'll need to move them manually.
    -- Also custom pages now gain the domain name they're created for. I.E.
       test.php becomes yourdomain.net_test.php but this does not effect the URL
       You'd still visit http://yourdomain.net/index.php?x=page&page=test or 
       http://yourdomain.net/page_test.htm depending on your CleanURLs setting.
 - Block Specific:
    -- Added Back To Top floating bar when page is scrolled, also auto-hides.
    -- Updated Categories Block to include new Stores page.
    -- Updated Feed Block to include credits link configurable from admin panel.
    -- Updated Feed Block date formats to be based upon region.
    -- Updated Feed Block limits.
    -- Fixed bug with Feed Block items not displaying when caching is disabled.
 - sfb Template Specific:
    -- Categories Block now mimics look of n3u template. 
 - All Templates Specific:
    -- As an additional SEO friendly fail-safe, Metatags are now used to prevent
       search engines from indexing search, item and index pages when no results
       are returned. This compliments the 404 not found header already returned.
    -- Usual minor adjustments/cleanup.


Changes since 13.05.10:
 - Changes:
    -- Updated ProsperentApi library to 2.1.9
    -- Increased results returned to 1000 items from initial limit of 100. This 
       may change in the future if Prosperent changes the limit in the future.

 - Fixes:
    -- Fixed issues where Performance Ads were not displaying.
    -- Fixed "Pages" page in Admin, Now displays correct example links if 
       n3u Niche Store is installed to a sub-directory.
 - Block Specific:
    -- Added CSS classes for blocks sorting orders to all templates.
    -- Removed all blocks out of default package. This is to avoid duplicate 
       blocks when updating etc. Now you must download each block you want and 
       upload to the blocks directory separately. As blocks are updated, they'll
       receive a post of their own on n3u.com. This will also help keep n3u 
       Niche Store light by not including the blocks that you may not want
	   (and allow more to be available without fear of getting too big).
 - n3u Template Specific:
    -- Some Admin Pages now show up in the top menu
    -- Custom Pages now show up in the top menu
 - All Templates Specific:
    -- Added Savings information to search and item results.
    -- Added Currency types based on the Prosperent Endpoint selected.

       navigated by visitors even with all blocks disabled.
    -- Added CSS for default Block view based on sorted position
    -- Templates now look for a style.php for dynamic css to include if exist.
    -- Minor adjustments/cleanup.

   information. This makes product urls slightly longer but at this point the
   visitor is only being redirected to merchant anyway.

       contact pages.
	-- Fixed search page behavior so that canonical urls default to sorting by
       relevance.

       are not indexed to minimize duplicate content.
	-- Added rel="next" & rel="prev" tags to paginated results.
 - Added anchor tag prefetching to number, and first/last pagination links.
   Note: No major browsers support anchor prefetching currently. Firefox states
   possible future support. With the variety of browsers out there today it
   seemed better to implement than to not. This may be revisited when link 
   prefetching is better explored or as standards change.
 - Removed ProsperLinks integration, Service is discontinued for newer members.
